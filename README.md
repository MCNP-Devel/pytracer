# PyTracer
Raytracing program written in Python, applying CT reconstruction methods

TODO :
- [x] Get transmission CT reconstruction working again
- [x] Nice display of transmission response
- [x] Create Single Fission Response per pixel, save
- [ ] Create Full Single Fission Response Measurement
- [ ] Apply brute force reconstruction methods

Longer Term TODO :
- [ ] Implement a BVH tree for segment intersection speed up
- [ ] Convert to gpu through CUDA (optional backend)
- [ ] Upgrade to Python 3 (latest)
